## A social network for making work contacts, with referrals and positive feedback from your friends

It has been said that referrals and positive word-of-mouth are the most effective ways to land yourself that great job. Linkr works on this principle, a social networking app to help you link up and get job faster.

By building up your network of your friends, they can help you get a job by endorsing you and leaving positive comments so potential employers spot you out. If you’re a recruiter, you’ll also be able to check who the most impressive job-seeker is.

To get going, you must register. Enter your mobile number to get sent a verification code. Invite your friends and links up to you Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn to make all your friend connections. More friends, more endorsements and a greater chance of getting a job.

The interface is attractive and has a familiar, Facbook-like format. Scroll down your newsfeed of jobs/jobseekers to see what’s happening. There’s a messaging function for you to communicate directly with contacts and you can share job ads via social media.

The app crashed a couple of times upon testing, but my guess is that these are just initial teething problems. The concept is a good one, but its success, like any social network, is dependent on the number of users. I like the fact that other users don’t get to see your connections too.
